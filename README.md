# Feeds Aggregator

A distributed RSS/Atom feed aggregator and article processor built with Go, Temporal, and AI-powered summarization.

## Overview

Feeds Aggregator is a scalable system that automatically monitors RSS and Atom feeds, processes new articles, and generates AI-powered summaries. The system uses Temporal for reliable workflow orchestration, MongoDB for storage, Redis for deduplication, and Ollama for generating article summaries with large language models.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

- **Ingester**: Periodically polls configured RSS/Atom feeds, detects new articles, and initiates processing workflows
- **Worker**: Executes Temporal workflows to fetch article HTML, store content, and generate AI summaries

## Features

- 🔄 Automatic feed polling and new article detection
- 📥 HTML content fetching and storage
- 🤖 AI-powered article summarization using Ollama (LLM)
- 🔁 Reliable workflow orchestration with Temporal
- 📊 Comprehensive observability with OpenTelemetry
- 💾 MongoDB storage for articles and metadata
